# FlightHub

## Summary
Flighthub is a model flight management system that allows users to look up flights on a given route and book tickets. 
It is implemented using Hibernate along with H2 database for data persistence and Object-Relational Mapping. GUI has been made in Java Swing. 

Please note that, as this is a model of a system, the current implementation focuses solely on booking tickets, and most other Use Cases that the system could have have not been implemented.
However, all the classes and associations between them have been modeled. 

Done as a final project for the MAS course at PJATK.
